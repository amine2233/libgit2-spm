# libgit2-ios

This repository was created as a demo/sample for a blog post on how to build and compile [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl), [libssh2](https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2), and [libgit2](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2) for use in iOS applications. After picking this back up for a new project, I have decided to break it up into three different repositories as individual Swift packages and possibly build a Swift API over them. I have also recompiled them for Apple M1 support and support for macOS as well as iOS.

For future use, please refer to the new repositories:

- __OpenSSL__: [mfcollins3/openssl-apple](https://github.com/mfcollins3/openssl-apple)
- __libssh2__: [mfcollins3/libssh2-apple](https://github.com/mfcollins3/libssh2-apple)
- __libgit2__: [mfcollins3/libgit2-apple](https://github.com/mfcollins3/libgit2-apple)
